# US flights
Data visualization of unique air routes across the US from 1995-2015

Inspired by the AirBNB visualization and [blog post](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/using-r-packages-and-education-to-scale-data-science-at-airbnb-906faa58e12d#.czt4te24n) by [Ricardo Bion](https://github.com/ricardo-bion/medium_visualization), I incorporated data from the TranStats website with some R code to create a similar visualization. I was also interested in seeing how much more connected US cities have become in the last 20 years by means of air travel. 

## Data
Source: TranStats, Airline Origin and Destination Survey, [DB1B](http://transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=125&DB_URL=Mode_ID=1&Mode_Desc=Aviation&Subject_ID2=0)
Note that the data represents a random 10% sample of all flights for a given year
###### It's also cool to see the BTS using [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) for their [data viz](http://transtats.bts.gov/)
